The eastest way to run Cfour with a Psi4-guess and compare with the build-in
core guess is the run_me script.
This is good for production runs.


A better documented version of the psi4_scf.py program is available as
a jupyter lab notebook in $project_root_dir/dev/Ci 
This is much better when starting new projects. 

For new molecules, a lot of user input and attention is required:
* The Psi4 versions of any basis sets should be put into the P4.BASIS file
  using the psi4.core basisset.genbas() function.
  This is probably not strictly needed, but Cfour tends to use general contraction, 
  while Psi4 uses segmented, so the MOs are slightly different.
* In both cfour_scf and psi4_scf.py, charge, multiplicity, and reference must be updated.
